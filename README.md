## How It Works

1. Users register or log in through a menu.
2. After logging in, users can view available subscription plans.
3. They can select a plan and start their subscription.
4. The system keeps track of their payment and start date.
5. Data is saved to a file so that it persists the next time the app is run.

## Technologies Used

- Java (Core Java)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
